# Handoff Notes

Last updated: 2026-07-16, after the large-capture and transactional-output P1
fixes and the accelerated-writer lifetime P2 fix.

This file is for maintainer/agent continuity. It is intentionally not installed
by CMake; release-facing installed docs are listed explicitly in
`CMakeLists.txt`.

## Current Repository State

- Active branch: `main`.
- Project version is `1.2.0` in `CMakeLists.txt`; `ld-compress-ng --version`
  prints `ld-compress-ng 1.2.0`.
- All `compress` backends now write through a same-directory temporary path and
  replace the requested destination only after successful finalization. The CLI
  regression forces partial CPU and native output before failure, then checks
  destination preservation, temporary cleanup, and successful replacement. It
  repeats the failure-preservation check for each available accelerator; the
  Vulkan branch will run automatically on a Vulkan-capable Linux test host.
- FLAC decompression now buffers 8,192 LDS groups (40 KiB packed output) per
  write and explicitly checks `FLAC__stream_decoder_finish()` for the
  STREAMINFO PCM-MD5 result. This replaces the former second MD5 pass over
  individual samples while retaining the corrupted-STREAMINFO regression and
  same-directory transactional output behavior.
- Potential scalar-native tuning point: profile `update_md5_s16le()` before
  changing it. It still updates the project MD5 once per four-sample LDS group;
  if that matters on Apple, batch the existing signed-16-bit little-endian PCM
  bytes, flush the final tail before STREAMINFO finalization, and keep updates
  on the ordered ingest thread rather than frame workers. This is not a current
  correctness or release blocker.
- The shared OpenCL/Vulkan/Metal selected-frame writer now gives each queued
  job shared ownership of its analyzed sample batch. If one worker fails, a
  sibling can finish unwinding without reading freed batch storage. The
  `accelerated_native_backend` regression forces this two-worker error path and
  passes under AppleClang AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
- 1.2.0 adds the macOS-only `metal` native FLAC accelerator backend using Apple
  Command Line Tools, `Metal.framework`, `Foundation.framework`, and runtime
  Metal source compilation. There is no Xcode project and no required offline
  `.metallib`.
- Metal exact compression now runs generated-LPC candidate population on the
  GPU before exact costing and selected-writer handoff. The previous
  `119.8 MB` six-fixture Metal baseline is obsolete; the current exact
  six-fixture output is within `0.032%` of native-fixed on Apple M5 Pro device
  `0`.
- The current Metal speed-profile checkpoint on Apple M5 Pro device `0` is
  `79,946,831` bytes in `0.626s` across the six local real fixtures, using
  `threads=8`, `frame=4608`, `lpc=12`, `prec=12`, Rice order `6`, and
  `analysis-profile=order-guess-mean-estimate-rice`.
- The managed Codex sandbox on macOS may hide `MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()`;
  sandboxed Metal tests should skip cleanly. Hardware validation should be run
  from a GPU-visible shell with:

  ```sh
  cmake -S . -B build-metal -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
      -DLDCOMPRESS_ENABLE_METAL=ON
  cmake --build build-metal --parallel
  build-metal/ld-compress-ng devices
  ctest --test-dir build-metal -L metal --output-on-failure
  ctest --test-dir build-metal --output-on-failure
  ```

- Also keep a no-Metal lane current:

  ```sh
  cmake -S . -B build-no-metal -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
      -DLDCOMPRESS_ENABLE_METAL=OFF
  cmake --build build-no-metal --parallel
  ctest --test-dir build-no-metal --output-on-failure
  ```

## Large-Capture STREAMINFO Follow-Up

The shared native FLAC writer now records an unknown (`0`) STREAMINFO
total-sample count when the actual count exceeds the 36-bit FLAC field. This
fix covers native-verbatim, native-fixed, OpenCL, Vulkan, and Metal; the
CPU/libFLAC backend already uses the same convention. Exactly 80 GiB of LDS
input is the first LDS-aligned count over the field limit. The decoder accepts
the unknown count and still validates the complete PCM MD5.

Boundary regression coverage and the macOS Metal/no-Metal suites are the local
validation baseline. A real capture over 80 GiB should still be exercised on a
GPU-visible Linux host through CPU, native-fixed, OpenCL, and Vulkan. The exact
commands, scratch-space warning, expected STREAMINFO value, and end-to-end
verification steps are in `docs/build-and-testing.md` under "Linux
Large-Capture STREAMINFO Validation".

## Accelerated Writer Lifetime Follow-Up

The macOS Metal and no-Metal suites pass the new device-independent regression.
Linux should replay it under AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, then
run the GPU-visible OpenCL and Vulkan lanes so the shared host path remains
covered with both Linux accelerators. Exact configure and test commands are in
`docs/build-and-testing.md` under "Linux Accelerated Writer Lifetime
Validation".

## 1.2 Final Metal Performance Checkpoint

This is the current 1.2.0 Metal performance baseline. It supersedes the older
M5/M6 Metal sections below, which are retained only as historical debugging
context.

Final speed-profile sweep artifact:
`build/real-fixture-sweeps/real-fixture-sweep-20260709-103103.{csv,md}`.

Command shape:

```sh
python3 tools/sweep_real_fixtures.py \
    --binary build-metal/ld-compress-ng \
    --threads 8 \
    --frame-samples 4608 \
    --lpc-order 12 \
    --lpc-precision 12 \
    --rice-partition-order 5,6 \
    --analysis-profile order-guess-mean-estimate-rice \
    --include-metal \
    --reuse-metal-session \
    --metal-device 0
```

| Backend | Rice order | Output bytes | Aggregate elapsed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Metal | `6` | `79,946,831` | `0.626s` |
| Linux OpenCL reference | `6` | `79,946,987` | `0.814s` |
| Linux Vulkan reference | `6` | `79,946,934` | `0.813s` |

The final Metal speed-profile path is byte-stable in the same output-size class
and is currently faster than the documented Linux OpenCL/Vulkan rice6 rows.
Accepted performance changes since the first Metal size-parity checkpoint
included Apple CommonCrypto MD5, pre-shifted autocorrelation input, and
pre-shifted exact-analysis input. The remaining obvious buckets are host scan,
selected-frame writing, fixed-order guess, and generated-path overhead; further
wins are architectural and are not required for 1.2.0.

## Historical 1.2 Metal M6 Size-Parity And Speed Checkpoint

This checkpoint is superseded by the final performance checkpoint above.

GPU-visible validation on Apple M5 Pro device index `0` passed after fixing the
Metal LPC task coefficient ordering and moving generated LPC onto the Metal
shader path:

- `build-metal/ld-compress-ng devices` saw Metal `[0] Apple M5 Pro` and OpenCL
  `[0] Apple M5 Pro`.
- `build-metal/test_metal_smoke --device 0` passed.
- `build-metal/test_metal_analysis --device 0` passed.
- `cmake --build build-metal --parallel` passed.
- `ctest --test-dir build-metal -L metal --output-on-failure` passed `3/3`.
- `ctest --test-dir build-metal --output-on-failure` passed `19/19`, with the
  expected optional Python/reference-loader skips.
- `compare_metal_scalar_frames` built under `build-metal-diagnostics` and on
  the first four `ggv-ntsc-mb-v2800` frames reported exact selected-writer
  recost parity for Metal-selected tasks
  (`metal_recost_delta_bits=0`, `metal_recost_mismatches=0`).

Full six-fixture `native-fixed,metal` roundtrip passed:

- Artifact:
  `build/real-fixture-roundtrips/real-fixture-roundtrip-20260708-185327/`.
- Each row ran `compress`, `verify --source`, `decompress`, and decoded
  size/MD5 comparison.

| Backend | Output bytes | Ratio | Aggregate compress time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Native-fixed | `79,867,690` | `0.532613` | `9.931s` |
| Metal | `79,892,801` | `0.532780` | `166.953s` |

Exact OpenCL+Metal sweep artifact:
`build/real-fixture-sweeps/real-fixture-sweep-20260708-185945.{csv,md}`.

| Backend | Output bytes | Ratio | Aggregate elapsed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Native-fixed | `79,867,690` | `0.532613` | `10.188s` |
| OpenCL | `79,892,332` | `0.532778` | `3.887s` |
| Metal | `79,892,801` | `0.532780` | `174.326s` |

At this checkpoint, Metal was `+25,111` bytes (`+0.0314%`) versus native-fixed in the
six-fixture exact roundtrip and `+469` bytes versus OpenCL in the exact sweep.
Exact Metal remained much slower than OpenCL, but it was no longer the old
compression-size outlier.

Speed-profile sweep artifact:
`build/real-fixture-sweeps/real-fixture-sweep-20260708-191154.{csv,md}`.

Command shape:

```sh
python3 tools/sweep_real_fixtures.py \
    --binary build-metal/ld-compress-ng \
    --include-opencl \
    --include-metal \
    --reuse-opencl-session \
    --reuse-metal-session \
    --opencl-device 0 \
    --metal-device 0 \
    --analysis-profile order-guess-mean-estimate-rice \
    --rice-partition-order 5,6
```

| Backend | Rice order | Output bytes | Aggregate elapsed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Native-fixed | `6` | `79,926,901` | `1.551s` |
| OpenCL | `6` | `79,946,777` | `1.602s` |
| Metal | `6` | `79,946,831` | `4.666s` |

This speed-profile row is obsolete; use the final Metal performance checkpoint
above for current performance expectations.

## Historical 1.2 Metal M5 Initial Correctness And Baseline Checkpoint

This was the first functional Metal checkpoint before the coefficient-ordering
and GPU generated-LPC fixes. Keep it only as historical evidence for the size
bug that the later checkpoints replaced.

GPU-visible validation on Apple M5 Pro device index `0` passed:

- `build-metal/ld-compress-ng devices` saw Metal `[0] Apple M5 Pro` and OpenCL
  `[0] Apple M5 Pro`; Vulkan was not built.
- `ctest --test-dir build-metal -L metal --output-on-failure` passed `3/3`.
- Real-fixture build:

  ```sh
  cmake -S . -B build-metal-real-fixtures \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
      -DLDCOMPRESS_ENABLE_METAL=ON \
      -DLDCOMPRESS_ENABLE_REAL_FIXTURE_TESTS=ON \
      -DLDCOMPRESS_REAL_FIXTURE_DIR=$PWD/reference/testdata/ld-decode-testdata-ci/1cf698d2025e8515e9ef57e34adaf85a194da96a \
      -DLDCOMPRESS_METAL_TEST_DEVICE=0
  cmake --build build-metal-real-fixtures --parallel
  ```

- `ctest --test-dir build-metal-real-fixtures -L real-fixtures -LE
  'opencl|vulkan' --output-on-failure` passed with `3/3`; the optional
  `ld-decode` loader compatibility tests skipped due missing optional Python
  reference-loader dependencies.
- `ctest --test-dir build-metal-real-fixtures -L metal --output-on-failure`
  passed `4/4`, with the optional Metal loader-compat test skipped.
- `ctest --test-dir build-metal-real-fixtures --output-on-failure` passed
  `24/24`, with six optional external-decode/reference-loader skips.

Full six-fixture `native-fixed,metal` roundtrip passed:

- Artifact:
  `build/real-fixture-roundtrips/real-fixture-roundtrip-20260708-172240/`.
- Each row ran `compress`, `verify --source`, `decompress`, and decoded
  size/MD5 comparison.

| Backend | Output bytes | Ratio | Aggregate compress time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Native-fixed | `79,867,690` | `0.532613` | `9.453s` |
| Metal | `119,832,125` | `0.799123` | `341.736s` |

Baseline sweep artifacts:

- Metal-only comparison:
  `build/metal-baseline-sweeps/real-fixture-sweep-20260708-172930.{csv,md}`.
- OpenCL+Metal comparison:
  `build/metal-opencl-baseline-sweeps/real-fixture-sweep-20260708-175114.{csv,md}`.

Best-row aggregate sizes from the OpenCL+Metal comparison sweep:

| Backend | Output bytes | Ratio | Aggregate elapsed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| CPU/libFLAC | `80,086,982` | `0.534075` | `2.666s` |
| Native-fixed | `79,843,831` | `0.532454` | `9.532s` |
| OpenCL | `79,876,133` | `0.532669` | `3.947s` |
| Metal | `119,775,018` | `0.798742` | `339.675s` |

Metal best rows were about `+49.56%` larger than CPU/libFLAC, `+50.01%`
larger than native-fixed, and `+49.95%` larger than OpenCL. OpenCL was
`+0.0405%` larger than native-fixed in the same sweep. Metal elapsed time was
dominated by `metal_lpc_s` plus `metal_exact_s`; `metal_choose_s` and
`metal_read_s` were effectively negligible. This baseline is now obsolete and
should not be used as the current Metal size/performance expectation.

## 1.1 Release Context

- `origin/main` was pushed to the 1.1.1 release-prep commit
  `a390f5a` (`Polish 1.1.1 release notes`) during the first publish attempt.
- Local `main` has one more release-validation/docs update on top of that push.
- Local branch `codex/vulkan-1.1` still exists as release-branch history
  context. It can be kept or deleted later.
- Annotated tag `v1.1.0` has been pushed to origin.
- Annotated tag `v1.1.1` exists locally and has not been pushed to origin.
  Make sure it points at the final release commit before pushing it.
- GitHub release was created as source-only, with no binary assets:
  `https://github.com/JoeyLemur/ld-compress-ng/releases/tag/v1.1.0`
## Post-1.1 Mainline Work

- Added benchmark/sweep-only native analysis profiles, including order-guess
  and mean-Rice speed profiles. The normal `compress` command still uses exact
  native analysis.
- Improved OpenCL throughput with selected Rice-parameter handoff, reusable
  generated-analysis sessions, larger accepted compression batches, and
  cooperative generated autocorrelation.
- Pipelined the shared accelerated host flow so the host can ingest/MD5 the next
  batch while the GPU analyzes one batch and then write the previous analyzed
  frames in order.
- Retained Vulkan/OpenCL compatibility through the shared native writer while
  improving accelerator sweep throughput.

Current accepted speed-focused reference:

- Sweep artifact:
  `build/real-fixture-sweeps/real-fixture-sweep-20260708-145656.{csv,md}`.
- Sweep shape: `threads=8`, `frame=4608`, `lpc=12`, `prec=12`, Rice orders
  `5,6`, `analysis-profile=order-guess-mean-estimate-rice`, OpenCL/Vulkan
  session reuse enabled.
- Six-fixture aggregate speed-profile rows:

  | Backend | Rice order | Output bytes | Elapsed time |
  | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
  | CPU/libFLAC | - | `80,086,984` | `2.440s` |
  | Native-fixed | `6` | `79,926,901` | `1.689s` |
  | OpenCL | `6` | `79,946,987` | `0.814s` |
  | Vulkan | `6` | `79,946,934` | `0.813s` |

- Validation for the wrap-up checkpoint: `cmake --build build` passed, full
  GPU-visible `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` passed with `21/21`
  tests, focused OpenCL/Vulkan/real-fixture CTest rerun passed with `9/9`
  tests, the all-six-fixture OpenCL/Vulkan roundtrip helper wrote
  `build/real-fixture-roundtrips/real-fixture-roundtrip-20260708-145623/`,
  and the final focused sweep above completed.

## What 1.1 Shipped

- Linux-first Vulkan native FLAC acceleration backend.
- OpenCL throughput improvements: larger batches, persistent analysis state,
  best-task readback, parallel exact/Rice costing, and cooperative generated
  autocorrelation.
- Shared accelerator host flow used by OpenCL and Vulkan.
- Real-fixture sweep support for OpenCL and Vulkan.
- Full OpenCL/Vulkan real-fixture roundtrip helper:
  `tools/roundtrip_real_fixtures.py`.
- Release/docs cleanup, including LGPL/CUETools notice coverage for the Vulkan
  shader path.

## 1.1 Release Validation That Passed

Required release gate:

```sh
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build -LE real-fixtures --output-on-failure
build/ld-compress-ng --version
build/ld-compress-ng --help
cmake -S . -B build-release-cpu-only -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
    -DLDCOMPRESS_ENABLE_OPENCL=OFF \
    -DLDCOMPRESS_ENABLE_VULKAN=OFF
cmake --build build-release-cpu-only --parallel
ctest --test-dir build-release-cpu-only -LE real-fixtures --output-on-failure
cmake --install build --prefix /tmp/ld-compress-ng-install-1.1-final
/tmp/ld-compress-ng-install-1.1-final/bin/ld-compress-ng --version
```

Observed results:

- Main build passed with OpenCL and Vulkan enabled.
- Non-real-fixture CTest passed: `17/17`.
- CPU-only lane passed: `16/16`, with PyAV/reference-loader tests skipped in
  that CPU-only build because the PyAV interpreter was not configured there.
- Install smoke passed and installed only release-facing docs:
  `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `docs/build-and-testing.md`, and
  `docs/release-checklist.md`.

Optional full local gate:

```sh
python3 tools/check_local_matrix.py \
    --build-root build/local-check-release \
    --all-local \
    --include-opencl-real-fixture \
    --opencl-device 1 \
    --include-vulkan-real-fixture \
    --vulkan-device 1 \
    --python-executable /home/epowell/.pyenv/versions/3.13.13/envs/ld/bin/python \
    --jobs 2 \
    --strict-optional
```

Observed result: all selected validation steps passed, including default,
no-OpenCL, no-Vulkan, FLAC test-file, scalar real-fixture, OpenCL real-fixture,
and Vulkan real-fixture lanes.

Exhaustive accelerator roundtrip:

```sh
python3 tools/roundtrip_real_fixtures.py \
    --backends opencl,vulkan \
    --opencl-device 1 \
    --vulkan-device 1
```

Final report:

- `build/real-fixture-roundtrips/real-fixture-roundtrip-20260708-145623/`
- Six local `.lds` fixtures, two backends, twelve total rows.
- Each row ran `compress`, `verify --source`, `decompress`, and decoded
  size/MD5 comparison against the source `.lds`.
- Aggregate input: `149,954,560` bytes.

| Backend | Output bytes | Aggregate compress time |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| OpenCL | `79,892,119` | `4.452s` |
| Vulkan | `79,892,217` | `3.938s` |

## Device Assumptions

Use a GPU-visible shell for accelerator validation. Sandboxed contexts can hide
the NVIDIA devices or expose only CPU Vulkan/llvmpipe.

Device indexes used for final validation on `smaug`:

- OpenCL device `1`: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti.
- Vulkan device `1`: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti.
- Vulkan device `0`: integrated AMD GPU. It is usable for functional smoke
  testing but should not be used for performance conclusions.
- Vulkan device `2`: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER.
- Vulkan device `3`: llvmpipe CPU Vulkan implementation.

AMD Vulkan support is intended through standard Vulkan compute design, but the
1.1 release did not validate discrete AMD hardware.

## Current Defaults And Useful Commands

Default compression remains CPU/libFLAC Ogg FLAC `.ldf` for compatibility:

```sh
build/ld-compress-ng compress capture.lds
```

Native FLAC backends write `.flac.ldf`. Use `opencl`/`vulkan` for accelerated
compression; keep `native-fixed` as a scalar reference/debug backend:

```sh
build/ld-compress-ng compress --backend native-fixed --threads 8 capture.lds
build/ld-compress-ng compress --backend opencl --device 1 --threads 8 capture.lds
build/ld-compress-ng compress --backend vulkan --device 1 --threads 8 capture.lds
```

Native tuning defaults:

- `--frame-samples 4608`
- `--lpc-order 12`
- `--lpc-precision 12`
- `--rice-partition-order 5`
- `--threads 1` by default

For routine OpenCL/Vulkan benchmark comparisons, use `--threads 8`. OpenCL and
Vulkan still default to one thread for `compress`, but additional threads
parallelize the CPU selected-frame writer after GPU analysis. Use CPU/libFLAC
for normal CPU-only compression; use `native-fixed` when scalar reference
behavior is needed.

Speed-profile sweep command shape:

```sh
python3 tools/sweep_real_fixtures.py \
    --binary build/ld-compress-ng \
    --fixtures reference/testdata/ld-decode-testdata-ci/1cf698d2025e8515e9ef57e34adaf85a194da96a \
    --threads 8 \
    --frame-samples 4608 \
    --lpc-order 12 \
    --lpc-precision 12 \
    --rice-partition-order 5,6 \
    --analysis-profile order-guess-mean-estimate-rice \
    --include-opencl \
    --reuse-opencl-session \
    --opencl-device 1 \
    --include-vulkan \
    --reuse-vulkan-session \
    --vulkan-device 1
```

## Important Decisions To Preserve

- Do not chase tiny OpenCL/Vulkan compression-ratio or runtime deltas unless a
  future task explicitly chooses a performance/tuning pass.
- Treat `native-fixed` and `native-verbatim` as reference/debug backends, not
  production CPU compression recommendations. Keep them available for scalar
  oracle, native writer, and fixture coverage.
- OpenCL/Vulkan outputs are compatible and roundtrip correctly on the validated
  Linux/NVIDIA host.
- The CPU/native writer remains the compatibility authority; accelerators choose
  analysis candidates and selected subframes.
- Vulkan and OpenCL may differ slightly in LPC coefficient/candidate choices due
  to floating-point summation/precision. Exact byte-for-byte candidate parity is
  not a release requirement.
- `docs/remote-sync.md` is maintainer-only and source-tree-only. Do not install
  it unless intentionally changing release doc policy.
- Preserve LGPL/CUETools notices in `src/opencl_analysis.cpp` and
  `shaders/vulkan_fixed_constant.comp` when modifying accelerator analysis code.
- Reference trees under `reference/`, `FlaLDF/`, and `ld-decode-tools/` should
  remain read-only unless a task explicitly says otherwise.

## Good Places To Resume Future Work

Start future work from the current local `main`. `origin/main` may still be at
the published `v1.1.0` release until the post-release mainline commits are
pushed, so check `git status --short --branch` and `git log --oneline -5`
before syncing.

Potential next branches:

- `codex/1.1.x-maintenance` for small bug fixes after the release.
- `codex/1.2-planning` for feature planning.
- `codex/amd-vulkan-validation` if discrete AMD hardware becomes available.

Reasonable next tasks:

- Validate Vulkan on real AMD discrete hardware and document results.
- Decide whether to keep, delete, or archive the merged `codex/vulkan-1.1`
  branch.
- If desired later, add binary packaging or GitHub Actions as a separate scoped
  plan; they were intentionally out of scope for 1.0/1.1.
- Revisit accelerator performance only at the architecture level. The next
  promising direction is reusable per-frame ingest facts or writer-ready
  residual/Rice state, not shader micro-tuning.
- For Metal follow-up, prioritize exact-speed work and overhead reduction; size
  parity against native-fixed/OpenCL is already within the current acceptance
  target on the six local fixtures.
