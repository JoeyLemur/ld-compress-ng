# Third-Party Notices

`ld-compress-ng` is licensed under LGPL-2.1-or-later. The full license text is
provided in `LICENSE`. The source tree also keeps a copy under
`LICENSES/LGPL-2.1-or-later.txt` for third-party notice continuity.

This project links against the system `libFLAC` and `libogg` libraries for the
CPU/Ogg FLAC path. The native FLAC encoder is project code, but its FLAC
analysis work is checked against the Xiph.org FLAC reference implementation
under `reference/flac/`.

The OpenCL and Vulkan analysis paths include reduced, locally modified
kernel/shader code and ABI-compatible analysis structures adapted from
CUETools.FLACCL. Preserve the LGPL notice in the kernel or shader source and
keep local modification notes when changing that code.

## CUETools.FLACCL Analysis Kernels

Portions of `src/opencl_analysis.cpp`, `shaders/vulkan_fixed_constant.comp`,
and the related Vulkan analysis glue are derived from or adapted from the
CUETools.FLACCL OpenCL encoder kernels for mono wasted-bits, LPC, residual, and
Rice-cost analysis.
